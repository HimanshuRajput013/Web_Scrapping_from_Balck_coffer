Project Title - Web Content Extractor and Text Analysis

This project offers a powerful framework for extracting and analyzing text data from web pages. It caters to various use cases where understanding the content and sentiment of online resources is crucial.

Functionalities

Web Content Extraction: Efficiently retrieve and parse text from a list of URLs.

Text Cleaning: Prepares the extracted text for analysis by removing unnecessary characters, stopwords (common, uninformative words), and punctuation.

Sentiment Analysis: Assigns sentiment scores to the cleaned text, including positive, negative, polarity (overall sentiment), and subjectivity (opinionated vs. factual).

Text Metrics: Computes valuable metrics to gain insights into the text's composition, such as the number of words and sentences.

Readability Analysis: Analyzes factors that affect how easily the text can be understood. This includes average sentence length, percentage of complex words (Flesch-Kincaid grade level), Fog Index, syllables per word, personal pronoun count, and average word length.
